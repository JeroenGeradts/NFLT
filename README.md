This prototype contains the Dutch Fiscal Learning Topics Taxonomy ("Nederlandse Fiscale Leerstukken Taxonomie" or "NFLT"), version December 21st, 2016. (https://fiscaletaxonomie.pleio.nl/groups/profile/27982362/download)

Features of the prototype include:

1. Navigate through the topics of the taxonomy and follow deeplinks to legislation
2. Deeplink to topics in the taxonomy
3. Fuzzy search and exact search of terms in the taxonomy
4. Export a portion of the taxonomy to Excel, starting from the current topic in view
5. Automatically tag the content of html-, txt-, rdf- and csv-files against the preferred terms and synonyms in the taxonomy

Remarks regarding the NFLT-taxonomy:

Ad 1. You can encounter the same title multiple times while navigating or searching as some preferred terms in the taxonomy are not unique
Ad 3. Idem
Ad 4. Export to Excel does not function for all topics due to inconsistensies in the taxonomy
Ad 5. All text between brackets in preferred terms and synonyms is ingnored when auto-tagging content, therefore some tags have the same name for multiple concepts
Ad 5. And some tags have the same name due to the not unique preferred terms
